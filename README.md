# AWS-DeepRacer-May2020

This repo contains my analysis notebook and reward function I used for an AWS Deep Racer League.
The source for the analysis notebook can be found here: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepracer-workshops/

## Findings:
* Adjust the action space, so the car can train at higher speeds
* Clone your models and "layer" different training environments
* Layer different reward functions (ie. focus on center-line, stay in-between track) 
* Speed up training with shallower network architecture
